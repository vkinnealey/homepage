            <h2> Welcome, this is my attempt at coding a blog for Web Development. Thus far, my blog is pretty pathetic, but Im working on it! </h2>
            <p1> For reference,
    <a href=http://webdevclass.greglinch.com> this is the link to our syllabus</a>. Ill keep you posted on my progress throughout the rest of the semester. As of now, my goals are as follows
</p1>
            <ol>
    <li> Better understand what a div is and the purpose is serves </li>
                        <li> Better understand CSC code and all of the function it serves </li>
                        <li> Memorize some of the basic coding terminologies, such as how to define a link, a paragraph, an image, etc. </li>
  </ol>
    <div class="test"> <p2> For some reason I cannot get the div to work... I keep trying different spacing and formats, but they do not seem to link to my css code. This will be something I discuss in class. </p2> </div>
